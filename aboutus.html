        Khandwa town in Western Madhya Pradesh. It is developed & promoted by Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development
        Corporation. The name “Hanumantiya” is derived from local village name with same name which lies in Punasa
        Tehsil of Khandwa district in Madhya Pradesh. State Tourism Department found this region suitable for water
        tourism activity so decided to develop it in which they developed the boat-club, accommodation facility, ensured
        good road connectivity etc.</p>
    <p>Backwater of Indira Sagar Dam forms a huge lake having enormous potential for tourism development. Hanumantiya is
        developed to exploit the backwater of this dam for tourism development in this region. Realizing this fact,
        Madhya Pradesh Tourism Department took initiative to develop the site and avail accommodation for tourists. It
        offers accommodation, restaurant and boating, cruise ride facility on backwater. For accommodation, only one
        hotel is available called “Hanuwantiya Tourist Complex” which is of MPSTDC. Surrounding area of dam is also good
